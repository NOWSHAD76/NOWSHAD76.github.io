						<h2>Automated Conversion of Static to Dynamic Scheduler via Natural Language</h2>
						
						<p>The paper explores the potential application of Large Language Models (LLMs) that will automatically model 
							constraints and generate code for dynamic scheduling problems given an existing static model. 
							Static scheduling problems are modelled and coded by optimization experts. These models may be easily 
							obsoleted as the underlying constraints may need to be fine-tuned in order to reflect changes in the 
							scheduling rules. Furthermore, it may be necessary to turn a static model into a dynamic one in order to 
							cope with disturbances in the environment. In this paper, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
							based LLM model to automate the process of implementing constraints for Dynamic Scheduling (RAGDyS), without 
							seeking help from an optimization modeling expert. Our framework aims to minimize technical complexities 
							related to mathematical modelling and computational workload for end-users, thereby allowing end-users to 
							quickly obtain a new schedule close to the original schedule with changes reflected by natural language 
							constraint descriptions.</p>

						<h3>Proactive Moderation: Real-Time Toxicity Prediction in Text</h3>
						<p>Developed a novel real-time toxicity prediction model that analyzes text as it is being
							written to determine if the user is likely to post harmful content. This represents an
							advancement over existing methods that can only classify toxicity after the full text is
							complete. The real-time nature of the model provides opportunities to intervene and guide
							users towards more positive interactions.</p>

						<h3>ConstraintSolverX: Harnessing Large Language Models as Dynamic Planners</h3>
						<p>This project focuses on developing a cutting-edge multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) 
							to tackle constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). This intelligent system possesses the unique ability 
							to comprehend, encode, execute, and iteratively refine CSPs, ensuring robust problem-solving.</p>

						<h3>AI Interview Coach</h3>
						<p>Contributed to an Omdena project creating an AI-powered chatbot that conducts initial
							screening interviews and provides feedback. The Interview Coach chatbot asks common
							questions then analyzes responses to supply candidates with coaching for improvement before
							critical later-stage discussions. This innovation streamlines early recruitment screening
							while equipping candidates with tools to strengthen interview skills.

						<h3>Beyond Popularity: Image-Driven Game Recommendations</h3>
						<p>Designed a game recommendation system that utilizes image similarity techniques to analyze
							gameplay images and match visual styles to user preferences. This enables more accurate
							recommendations compared to methods that rely solely on game popularity and reviews. The
							system uniquely incorporates image data along with other metadata to recommend new games
							based on both visual and gameplay aspects that users enjoy.</p>

						<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
						<h3>Towards Smarter Financial Decisions: Transcript Analytics with NLP</h3>
						<p>Developed a natural language processing system to extract actionable insights from lengthy
							financial transcripts. The system utilizes topic modeling and sentiment analysis to
							automatically identify key topics discussed and the sentiment surrounding them. It also
							summarizes transcripts to enable rapid review by financial analysts. This saves significant
							time versus manual transcript analysis and provides a competitive advantage by identifying
							salient topics early.</p>

						<h3>Boosting Productivity and Performance: Scalable ML with SageMaker Pipelines</h3>
						<p>Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline on AWS SageMaker to enable efficient
							iterations from data preprocessing to model deployment. Implemented automated data
							preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning jobs to optimize model training with minimal manual
							effort. Built capabilities for auto-scaling model inferences to handle production workloads
							with dynamic demand.</p>
